Sometimes we face problems when we are trying to input "String" after inputting int/float/double/long/byte/short/char.
It is because before coming to the String we've hit the enter button and the String takes that enter as "\n" String characters.
Hence by hitting enter, we have already given the input to the String.
And it goes to the next statement.
